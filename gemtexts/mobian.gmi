## Mobian

If you are a fan of using Debian on your desktop machine, laptop, or even your server, then youâ€™re going to feel right at home with Mobian. Mobian is a "Mobile Debian" and is essentially Debian scaled down to a Phosh overlay.

Currently, Mobian is based on Debian Bullseye. Built by developer a-wai and a small team of contributors, it is fast becoming one of the most usable Linux mobile distributions for the PinePhone.

The Mobian team doesn't plan to stop with the PinePhone either - they also eventually have plans to port the distro to Purism's Librem 5.
