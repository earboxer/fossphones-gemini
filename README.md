# fossphones-gemini
FOSSphones on the Gemini protocol. Because we're cool like that. 

## Updates:
I'll post updates on my progress on getting this done as it becomes available. I'm looking forward to also serving **FOSSphones** as a gemini site, as well as its http equivalent. Planning on also serving my personal site on gemini, so this will be fun!

Will update this repo soon with some gemini pages for FOSSphones - gotta convert 'em from HTML.
