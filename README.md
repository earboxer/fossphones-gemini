FOSSphones on the Gemini protocol. Because we're cool like that. 

## Wanna help? 
If you want to help, feel free to pull up FOSSphones.com and give me a hand in copying over the HTML pages to Gemtext. I have a few pages done so far, and you can see how the layout sort of looks in the **./gmi** file in this repo. If you have a better idea for a layout, I'm all ears! Feel free to send a pull request if you want to help FOSSphones in this Gemini project - it is greatly appreciated!

## Also!
Got any ideas for articles about Linux Phones? Or a piece of Linux Phone news we might have missed? Please feel free to write up an article (*include your name, nickname, and contact handle*) if you want to have it posted on the Gemini and HTTPs versions of FOSSphones. We are always happy to share any content about Linux Phones with the world. Just format your article in HTML or gemtext and send it over through a pull request - I will check it out and merge it. :)
